    <p class="a">
        Some of the most treasured artwork is Literature. One of the most famous of all of Russian literature
        is 'Crime and Punishment', by Fyodor Dostoevsky. <br> <br>
        "Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov,
         an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, 
         an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money 
         he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince
         himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles 
         to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself 
         racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their 
         power as he struggles with guilt and horror and confronts both the internal and external 
         consequences of his deed." <br>
